Demo 1 for Rive Exploration Project, created by Jake Andrade

This demo explores how Rive can be used to implement interactive elements in a webpage with little engineering effort and great performance.

Next steps:
- Changing the loader from an overlay into being an element in a pop-up, to better show how Rive elements can be embedded into a webpage
