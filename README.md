Demo 1 for Rive Exploration Project, created by Jake Andrade

This demo explores how Rive can be used to implement interactive elements in a webpage with little engineering effort and great performance.

How to use:
- Move the slider to select how long you'd like the loading pop-up to run for (in milliseconds)
- Press "Start loading" and the pop-up will appear until the 'loading' is complete
